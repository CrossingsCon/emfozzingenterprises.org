Welcome to the homepage of Emfozzing Enterprises, Inc! We are a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting the works of speculative fiction authors and the speculative fiction genre by creating a space online and in person that facilitates discussion, analysis, recommendation, and distribution of these works.

We want to make it easy for people to bring the things they love, share them with others, and find paths to new areas of interest. We started as a group of fans for Diane Duane's _Young Wizards_ series, but what we discovered is that everyone we met had something cool they cared about to share, and that fiction tied it all together. Our spaces are dedicated to being accessible, welcoming, imaginative, and exploratory; come join us and discover what thing you didn't know you were going to learn about today!

If you'd like to support what we do, consider joining our [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/emfozzing).

Emfozzing Enterprises sponsors three main things:

- [CrossingsCon](https://www.crossingscon.org), a convention about the _Young Wizards_ series and all the other universes out there that we visit when we read
- [The Crossings Slack](http://www.crossingscon.org/community/slack/), the online reflection of that convention that doesn't have to end after three days. You can sign yourself up for an account [here](http://slackin.emfozzingenterprises.org/)
- [Linguistics After Dark](http://linguisticsafterdark.com/), a linguistics podcast spawned from a particularly popular event at CrossingsCon 2019
